        The website is dedicated to showcasing the history of Israel's borders by visualizing the country's territorial transformations over time. Visitors can explore an interactive map that chronicles the evolution of Israel's boundaries from its biblical roots to the present day.
In the creation of this website, I hope to present a neutral and fact-based account of Israel's border history, and aim to foster a better understanding of the complex geopolitical dynamics surrounding the region.
